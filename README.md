# MPI-x-Multiprocessing
In this project, I set out to compare two parallel computing approaches in Python—multiprocessing and mpi4py—by implementing a numerical integration of the sine function over the interval [0, π] using the Riemann sum method with a substantial number of subdivisions (N = 1e9).
